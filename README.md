# Number_Guessing_Game

The # user_guess.py file is a number guessing game where the computer chooses a number between 1 and 100 and the user has 10 chances to guess the number. If the user guesses less than that number, the system says that the number is small, and if the number is bigger, the game says that the guessed number is bigger than the requested number.

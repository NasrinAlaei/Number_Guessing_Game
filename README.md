# Number_Guessing_Game

The "user_guess.py" file is a number guessing game where the computer chooses a number between 1 and 100 and the user has 10 chances to guess the number. If the user guesses less than that number, the system says that the number is low, and if the number is bigger, the game says that the guessed number is high than the requested number.


The "sys_guess.py" file is a reverse game of guessing numbers where the user chooses a number between 1 and 100 and the system has 10 chances to guess that number. If the system guesses less than that number, the user says that the number is low and set a numerical range between the guessed number and 100 so that the system knows that a bigger number should be guessed, and if the number is bigger, the user says that the guessed number is high and set a number range between 1 and the guessed number so that the system knows that a smaller number should be guessed.
